+ bifurcation diagram
+ bifurcation diagram in parallel
+ write bifurcation data to CSV
+ more concise ways to do different plots etc... map write function?
+ find phase relationship (Fourier? min/max correlation)
+ nicer way to manage parameters, instead of passing globals?
+ factor out models
+ use regular api (for labels)
